# CryptoHack #

Cryptographic challenges are indeed fascinating and provide a great opportunity to delve deeper into the field of applied cryptography. 
They offer me a chance to explore various cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and techniques while also honing your programming skills.

During childhood, I would often picture of a  casket  having a key only with me and wish none
 could break it open in any way .
 
Cryptography, solving Crypto-puzzles fulfilled my childhood fantasy. I wouldn’t claim that
cryptography allows me to create an unbreakable casket, but it's closer to one.

By solving cryptographic challenges, I not only gained a better understanding of how different cryptographic systems work but improved my C++ problem-solving abilities and analytical thinking.




# [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) #

Cryptopalsis a popular collection of exercises designed to teach and demonstrate various aspects of applied cryptography. Created by the Matasano Security LLC team, Cryptopals offers a hands-on approach to learning cryptography by focusing on practical challenges and real-world scenarios.

The challenges have been grouped under 8 sets and definitely are the best problems combining Programming+ Mathematics+ Crypto.

# Motivation #


Solving cryptographic problems is not for the faint of heart. 
It demands strength of mind and spirit. It requires the resilience to endure setbacks and the commitment to persevere.
In the face of bugs, errors, and frustrations, I used to find strength by listening to music. It kept me focused, motivated, and made the journey enjoyable.
